Executive Summary

Music is big business. Streaming websites are the new marketplaces, serving as modern platforms to access an almost unlimited source of songs for listeners and revenue for artists and their labels. Understanding and predicting popularity of songs prior to and after their release proves to be very valuable as it can assist in providing targeted song/album marketing strategies. However, businesses and researchers have yet to find the optimal way to define and predict song and artist popularity. This report aims to complement existing research by describing the popularity features of chart-topping songs in YouTube and Spotify.

Our results suggest that the popularity features of top-charting songs in both Spotify and YouTube have a lot in common. Aided by a relative ranking that we designed to normalize and connect rankings of both platforms, acoustic features alone do not appear to explain popularity. Traditional record labels still dominate the charts, but it is the platforms who enable their ability to reach hyper targeted markets (for example, through microgenres). Evaluation of these popularity features may be useful to replicate in narrower contexts, and can be used as preparatory work for other machine learning efforts in predicting popularity of songs in these two platforms.
